# odin_etchasketch
This is for the Odin Project etch-a-sketch project in the foundations course.

Learned how to loop a grid of divs onto DOM. Learned how to use a button to perform a function. Learned how to select and modify html/DOM elements via functions.

Could adjust code to ensure grid is made of responsive squares, but outside of the scope of this project and need to keep moving.
